# fuck-turnips
Uploading it here because I want to clear out my code folder. Really nothing to see here. It's a simple script that signed petition for me on Change.org. 

[The petition was to ban turnips](https://www.change.org/p/farmers-ban-turnips)

## Problems

So, at first it worked and I got like 40 signs but then change.org started to remove those petitions (idk why?) because maybe they were from the same location? So I added different locations, that worked, but then after some time, they again start to remove petitions. Then I got tired and went to sleep.
